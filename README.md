# Hohoemu (STILL IN DEVELOPEMENT)
My Bachelor's thesis project.

This project is an educational tool designed to help students learn x86-64 assembly programming by providing an interactive GUI. It uses the Unicorn CPU emulator framework to execute assembly code and offers a user-friendly GUI with debugging-like functionality. 

# Key features include:
  * Step-by-step execution of assembly code, allowing students to follow the program flow instruction by instruction
  * Visual indication of the current instructions to be executed
  * Display of CPU register values and the content of the stack after each instruction
